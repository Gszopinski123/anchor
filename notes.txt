I want my local host to connect to my pod in the cluster specifically my kubernetes pods. I then want this local host to accept rpc commands.
all functions need to have the return type of void


to root into a pod in k8 -> kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
linux issue with hostname being true

need to setup topics before connecting via hub
